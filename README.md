ECART APPLICATION
this is a ecommerce application where user can see all the products in home page. Also user can add the product into the cart page. Also user can increase and decrease the item from the cart and remove the item from the cart. We can get the sum of Amount of all products that have been added to the cart. Also there is a simple login and register page.we can easily validate the user credentials.
In this project I used Javascript library named REACT along with JSX,some third party libraies of react like react-router-dom, react-icons etc, for state management I use Redux Toolkit and for styling purpose I used CSS and BOOTSTRAP.
